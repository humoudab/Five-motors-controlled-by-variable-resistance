# Five-motors-controlled-by-variable-resistance
An electrical circuit that is controlled by five servo motors is designed by five variable resistors for each resistance motor and the appropriate symbols are written for that
This project can control five servo motors by means of a variable resistance.
This project is good for the needs of the robot designers.
The user can move the variable resistance of the motor in order to be able to move it.
